# Digits-NN
Solution for the [Digits Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) competition on Kaggle.

I used a Neural Network with Dense layers and sigmoid activation function for the nodes for training
the model.

The training data `train.csv` was divided into training data and validation data.
